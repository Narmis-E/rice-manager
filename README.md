Rice Manager streamlines the process of managing and switching between dotfile configurations on Linux. It follows the ricing philosophy of maintaining all configs in a central location and linking them together, from one place.

### With Rice Manager you can:
- Easily add, remove and apply rices
- Give your rices descriptive names
- Seamlessly switch between different rices and themes
- Keep your system configs organized

### Built for Ricing Enthusiasts

As an avid ricer, I found manually managing dotfiles between different configurations to be somewhat tedious and no other tools existed that provided what I was looking for.\
I created Rice Manager as an excuse to build something useful with GTK and Python. The result is a tool tailored to the Linux ricing workflow, making it easy to organize and switch between rices.
